-- Brief --

 This is intended to be a daemon that manages a wifi interface of
 a Linux based IoT device.

-- Requirements --

 Software:
 libmicrohttpd with TLS enabled
 udhcpd/udhcpc (part of busybox)
 wpasupplicant
 
 Hardware:
 wifi interface that supports NL80211 and supports a station VIF 
 and an access point VIF simultaneously. This is apparently less
 common than you might think. 

 <Insert list of working interfaces here>
 
 Chipsets/Drivers that will not work:
 RTL8188EU and variants	-	Could potentially work with the Realtek
 							driver and their weird concurrent interface
 							mode but would require lots of work. The
 							mac80211 driver doesn't seem to support 
 rt3071/rt2800usb		-	driver supports nl80211 but can't have a
 							station and an ap up at the same time.
