-- Brief --

 This is intended to be a daemon that manages a wifi interface of
 a Linux based IoT device.

-- Requirements --

 Software:
 libmicrohttpd with TLS enabled
 udhcpd/udhcpc (part of busybox)
 wpasupplicant
 
 Hardware:
 wifi interface that supports NL80211 and supports a station VIF 
 and an access point VIF simultaneously. This is apparently less
 common than you might think.
