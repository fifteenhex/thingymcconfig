## Brief

 This is intended to be a daemon that manages a wifi interface of
 a Linux based IoT device.

## Requirements --

 Software:
 libmicrohttpd with TLS enabled
 udhcpd/udhcpc (part of busybox)
 wpasupplicant
 
 Hardware:
 wifi interface that supports NL80211 and supports a station VIF 
 and an access point VIF simultaneously. This is apparently less
 common than you might think. 

 <Insert list of working interfaces here>
 
### Chipsets/Drivers that will not work (yet)
 RTL8188EU and variants	      Could potentially work with the Realtek
			      driver and their weird concurrent interface
			      mode but would require lots of work. The
			      mac80211 driver doesn't seem to work yet.
 
 rt3071/rt2800usb	      Driver supports nl80211 but can't have a
			      station and an ap up at the same time.
 
 Qualcomm QCA9377/ath10k      ath10k driver and chipset supports
			      all the functionality required but usb
			      support is experimental and doesn't seem
			      to work. SDIO might.

## Protocol
